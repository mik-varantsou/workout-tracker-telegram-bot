- [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) package manager

## Setup and Build

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mik-varantsou/workout-tracker-telegram-bot.git
cd workout-tracker-telegram-bot
```

### 2. Install dependencies with vcpkg
If you donâ€™t have vcpkg installed yet, clone and bootstrap it first:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git

cd vcpkg

.\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
```

Then install the required libraries:
```bash
.\vcpkg.exe install sqlitecpp zlib openssl curl boost-system boost-filesystem boost-property-tree boost-lexical-cast boost-asio
```

Integrate vcpkg with your system (optional but recommended):

```bash
.\vcpkg.exe integrate install
```


### 3. Configure and build the project
Make a build directory and generate build files with CMake, specifying the vcpkg toolchain file. Replace path\to\vcpkg with your actual vcpkg folder path:

```bash
mkdir build

cd build

cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=path\to\vcpkg\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake

cmake --build .
```
This will compile the project and produce an executable.
---

## Configuration
To run the bot, you need a Telegram bot token:
1. Create a .env file in the project root (same folder as tgbot_new.exe)
2. Add your token inside .env like this:
   ```ini
   BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token_here
   ```
Keep this token secret â€” do not share it publicly.

## Running the Bot
After building, run the executable from the build folder:
```bash
.\tgbot_new.exe
```
